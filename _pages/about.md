# 👋 About Me
I recently received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)** in 2025, advised by Prof. [Yanru Zhang](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/yanruzhang/en/index.htm). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Hainan University** in 2022.  

🎯 <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026.</span>    
If you are interested in my background or research, please feel free to contact me. I’m always open to academic discussion and collaboration!

# 🔍 Research
My primary research interest lies in the domain of **Trustworthy AI**, encompassing **explainability**, **robustness**, **faithfulness**, and **reliability** of large language models and their applications. Specifically, my research interest currently focuses on:  
⚡ **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Reasoning, and LLM-based agent systems.  
⚡ **AI4Code**: Code generation, evaluation, and improving the reliability and usability of code produced by LLMs.  
⚡ **Social Media Analysis**: Multimodal learning, and Social Media Prediction.
